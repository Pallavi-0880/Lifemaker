## This is the founding ground for human union

To agree on same values of Life is the stepping stone to coming together for a grand party on Earth as one couple, family, team or undivided human society for justful, truthful & successful co-existence as humans.

Here we identified and enlisted some 30 values which are seen in enlightened Human Living. The explanation of every value may be done in so many ways and words, yet the essence of each value is to be realised by the heart and understood by the mind. The list of values may evolve with time and is left to the society to do so, with consensus.

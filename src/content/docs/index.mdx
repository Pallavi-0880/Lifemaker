#### **But how are we living today?**
*Physical facility > health > relationships.. And uh, I don’t feel the need 
to understand much more. I am so busy with my work and have also finished my education!*

If a human being doesn’t have understanding, it suffers whether or not realizing it. 
It stays discontent in relationships, develops poor health and has an unhelpful and 
unsatisfactory equation with physical facility, even if very rich. Indeed today we are 
all suffering because of our lack of understanding as individuals and society. It is clear 
that while we want to educate ourselves and our children, we have so far not even understood
who we are as human, what are the needs of a human and what is the fundamental purpose of
education for a human. Is education about just getting literacy and skills for getting a
professional job? What is education? Hence as a result, today we have a society where there
are many problems all around - in individual lives and as a collective.

Realization of universal knowledge and resolution, is the need, purpose, 
opportunity and challenge of every human life. With knowledge of the self, 
a human becomes true to itself, i.e. it becomes free of all mental corruption,
conflict, tension, fear, stress, worry etc., which arise from assumptions,
thoughts, attachments, expectations and desires stemming from an improper
understanding. Knowledge, i.e. being the pure self as-I-am, is the only and 
stable source of happiness, peace, satisfaction and joy, that lasts. Knowledge
is the doorway to real, everlasting freedom and self governance. Knowhow and
talent, i.e. how to live, navigate, cocreate with the laws of Nature is useful 
for living as humans. Hence, to ensure holistic education within and in family/society
is a need and responsibility of every human. From there the resolution flows contagiously to the rest.

### **This is Undivided World Family**
Here we are not talking of any sect or religion. The object of Undivided human society unconditionally includes 
and loves every human as part of it, because only with unconditional acceptance we start to be undivided. And reality 
is that we are indeed undivided by nature, but only divided by our imaginary boundaries and conflicts.


So, everyone is invited to participate in this program by getting introduced to the proposals and attaining self realization and understanding of the same.

## **Coming together with a shared, universal perspective is our need, opportunity and the only refuge**

*We may have different viewpoints on nature of Self and reality, different skin color, occupations and opinions, 
but as humans we are all fundamentally same and thereafter similar. Through honest objective and subjective 
inquiry humanity as society and each human is bound to understand and realise Truth in the same way, 
because we exist in the same Truth. Our sameness as humans, the onlyness of Truth (Existence in which we co-exist), 
honest self inquiry for Truth, and agreement on the way to live, is the (only) unifying ground, which will 
provide Life the absolute and permanent resolution it needs and seeks.*

## **What’s happening 2020?**
- Pilot by members of Village Saalig & in Dharamsala town, Himachal Pradesh, with help of thinkers and wise humans 
from India. The village community is starting to get inspired by the vision. We are making and documenting the 
action plan for next steps, gathering team and have been executing already on the education (understanding) 
front, which is the main entry point for anyone into the program.

- Our group is regularly meeting and collaborating as likeminded society members. We are engaging in discussions and documentation of
>> - Aims, objectives, universal human values, policies, constitution
>> - Working model
- Setting up of online discussion forum and universal education module

## **We are thankful**
- Thanks to every human of past and present, who has contributed in their unique ways
- Thanks to all the messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers, parents 
and all loving beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish 
to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential.
- Thanks to the Universal Teacher.
